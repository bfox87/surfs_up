# Analysis of Oahu Weather Data

## Overview:
### Background:
To live and surf in Oahu as a resident, we are opening a business selling surf equipment and ice cream. Outside investors are needed and one of them, W. Avy, is concerned about the impact weather could have on the business's success. He has a weather dataset for the island that he wants analyzed before he commits any money to our venture.

### Purpose:
Some additional analysis of temperature trends in Oahu is needed. To remain open year-round, the surf n' shake business needs favorable weather conditions in both the summer and winter months. Gathering weather statistics for the months of June and Decemeber will help determine this.

## Results:
- There is more robust dataset of temperature data for June than December. At a count of 1,700 there are almost 200 more temperature observations for June in the years sampled than in December (count=1517).

- There is more temperature variation in December than in June. The December standard deviation is higher and there is a larger difference between the minimum and maximum temperatures sampled than those in June. This makes sense that even in a tropical setting, the winter could see stronger swings in temperature.

- June offers more favorable weather, temperature-wise, for the shop than December. The December temperatures are not cold by any means. However, the June statistics reveal that temperatures in the 70s are often "the norm." It is not very likely that temperatures will dip below 70 degrees, which could be considered "cool" by Hawaiian standards and result in slower business.



## Summary:
Oahu's weather is well suited for our surf n' shake shop. The climate is warm and there really is not a great deal of difference in average temperatures in June versus those in December.

#### Additional Queries for Further Insight:
The precipitation statistics for June and December would also be good to have. Knowing temperarture is useful, but how wet those months are on average could have a major impact on the success or failure of the shop.

Aditionally, precipitation averages by month would be good to see. This way, we can determine if there are certain months that stand out as much wetter. Then we can potentially plan our business hours accordingly for those months.
